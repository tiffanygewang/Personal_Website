title: "Oxford CCAI Present at Oxford MPLS Science Together"
The Colloquium assembles researchers from Oxford and from Goodenough working in AI, philosophy, legal regulation and public policy to consider how best the development of AI might be framed and regulated across different governments and societies. I present a talk on Age-Appropriate AI: Gaps, challenges, and what may future look like - AI systems are becoming increasingly pervasive within children’s devices, apps, and services. However, it is not yet well-understood how risks and ethical considerations of AI relate to children, and what that means for future AI regulations?

The Oxford CCAI (Child-Centred AI) team were well presented in Oxford University MPLS' Science Together 2022.

We had the pleasure to run a taster App Club session with 27 students coming from Oxford Academy, based on the six-week programme we developed with LeysCDI (see app club). We were privileged to share our experience of setting up the Leys App Club during the evening Sofa Chat session in the stunning Museum of Natural History.

Check out the recording of our conversation (below). We can't wait to continue more exciting collaborations with the CDI in the future! Look out for this space!
