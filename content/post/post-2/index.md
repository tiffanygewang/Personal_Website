The Oxford CCAI (Child-Centred AI) team were well presented in Oxford University MPLS' Science Together 2022.

We had the pleasure to run a taster App Club session with 27 students coming from Oxford Academy, based on the six-week programme we developed with LeysCDI (see app club). We were privileged to share our experience of setting up the Leys App Club during the evening Sofa Chat session in the stunning Museum of Natural History.

Check out the recording of our conversation (below). We can't wait to continue more exciting collaborations with the CDI in the future! Look out for this space!
