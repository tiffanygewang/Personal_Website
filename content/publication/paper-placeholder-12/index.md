publication_short: "![honorable mention](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tiffanygewang/tiffany.ge.wang/master/assets/media/newline.png) Written Evidence Submitted by Oxford University Child-Centred AI"

abstract: "This written evidence is submitted by Dr Jun Zhao (Senior research fellow) and Ms Ge Wang
(Final year DPhil student) on behalf of Oxford University’s Child-Centred AI initiative1, led by
Dr Zhao, which is part of Human Centred Computing Group2 of the Department of Computer
Science at Oxford University. We have extensive experience in working and researching
together with children and families to understand how data-driven algorithmic systems
affect their online experiences and how to design better technologies for them. We have
published extensively in premier academic conferences and journals on this topic and
contributed to recent policy and regulatory developments in relation to data protection for
children and online safeguarding for children, led by the UK CDEI, ICO, DCMS, the Council of
Europe and other non-profit organisations (such as 5Rights or Terre de Homes)."
