abstract: "Third-party tracking allows companies to collect users' behavioural data and track their
activity across digital devices. This can put deep insights into users' private lives into the
hands of strangers, and often happens without users' awareness or explicit consent. EU and
UK data protection law, however, requires consent, both 1) to access and store information
on users' devices and 2) to legitimate the processing of personal data as part of third-party
tracking, as we analyse in this paper."
