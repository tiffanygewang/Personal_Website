abstract: "AI systems and related algorithms are starting to play a variety of roles in the digital ecosystems of children - being embedded in the connected toys, smart home IoT technologies, apps, and services they interact with on a daily basis. Going forward, AI systems will, in all likelihood, become  even more pervasive in children's applications simply due to their sheer usefulness in creating compelling, adaptive, and personal user experiences. Yet, understanding the ways that AI-driven systems used by children operate, and how AI could be designed to better anticipate and respond to children's diverse requirements is still a new and emerging area of investigation. \textit{Our goals} of this workshop are to (1) extend the current critically constructive dialogue around the meaning of child-centred AI design and (2) explore ways to operationalise such child-centred AI design in practice, and finally (3) further expand and foster a community for those who are interested in designing and developing child-centred AI systems."
