title: Ge Wang
role: DPhil (Ph.D.) student
bio: I’m a Dphil student in the Department of Computer Science at University of Oxford. My research investigates the algorithmic impact on families and children, and what that means for their long-term development. I’m keen to explore the potential for designing more age-appropriate AI for families, as well as building more ethical web and data architecture for them. My research takes a human-centric approach, and focuses on understanding users' needs in order to design technological prototypes that are of real impact on today's society.

I’m a Dphil student in the Department of Computer Science at University of Oxford, the {{< staticref "https://hcc.cs.ox.ac.uk/" "newtab" >}}Human Centred Computing group{{< /staticref >}}. My Dphil is supervised by Professor Sir Nigel Shadbolt, Dr. Jun Zhao, and receives kind support from Professor Max Van Kleek and Professor Reuben Binns. 

I'm on the {{< staticref "https://twitter.com/oxfordccai" "newtab" >}}OxfordCCAI{{< /staticref >}} team, which stems from our work in the {{< staticref "https://koala.web.ox.ac.uk/home" "newtab" >}}KOALA{{< /staticref >}} project. My research investigates the algorithmic impact on families and children, and what that means for their long-term development.
